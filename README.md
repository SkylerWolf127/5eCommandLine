A Java command line program that implements the Dungeons and Dragons 5e Character sheet. Make some stuff!!!

Currently working on adding so many features. (In no particular order...)
* Save / load
* GUI Fork
* Automatic modifier / spell slots
* Preset lists for classes and subclasses
* Random character generator
* Evil scary enemy generator???
* Idk what I'm doing here TBH.
